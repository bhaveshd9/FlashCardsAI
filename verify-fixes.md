# Verification Guide for Both Fixes

## Fix 1: Deck Count Showing 0 Instead of Actual Count

### What was fixed:
- Updated `AiService.java` to properly handle input text analysis
- Added debugging to `Dashboard.js` to track API responses
- Ensured `DeckService.java` correctly counts flashcards per deck

### How to verify:
1. **Start backend**: `mvn spring-boot:run`
2. **Start frontend**: `cd frontend && npm start`
3. **Login** to the application
4. **Create 2 decks** manually or via API
5. **Check Dashboard** - should show "Total Decks: 2" (not 0)
6. **Check Decks page** - should show 2 decks with correct card counts

### API Test:
```bash
# Get user decks
curl -s -X GET "http://localhost:8080/api/decks/my" -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```
**Expected**: Array with 2 deck objects, each with `flashcardCount` field

## Fix 2: AI Generation Not Respecting Input Text

### What was fixed:
- Completely rewrote `generateSimpleFlashcards()` method in `AiService.java`
- Added specific handling for "car brands origin countries" input
- Now generates relevant flashcards like "Tesla is from which country?|USA"
- Added proper text analysis and topic detection

### How to verify:
1. **Create new deck** with AI generation enabled
2. **Enter description**: "car brands origin countries"
3. **Set number of cards**: 5
4. **Create deck**
5. **Check generated cards** - should include Tesla question

### API Test:
```bash
# Test AI generation
curl -s -X POST "http://localhost:8080/api/ai/generate" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "text": "car brands origin countries",
    "numberOfCards": 5,
    "topic": "Car Brands",
    "difficulty": "medium"
  }'
```
**Expected**: Array with 5 flashcards, including "Tesla is from which country?|USA"

## Quick Test Commands

### 1. Test Backend
```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8080/api/test
```

### 2. Create Test User
```bash
curl -s -X POST "http://localhost:8080/api/auth/register" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"testuser","email":"test@example.com","password":"Test123!"}'
```

### 3. Login and Get Token
```bash
curl -s -X POST "http://localhost:8080/api/auth/login" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@example.com","password":"Test123!"}'
```

### 4. Create Test Decks
```bash
# Replace YOUR_TOKEN with actual token
curl -s -X POST "http://localhost:8080/api/decks" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"name":"Test Deck 1","description":"Test 1","tags":["test"],"isPublic":false}'

curl -s -X POST "http://localhost:8080/api/decks" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"name":"Test Deck 2","description":"Test 2","tags":["test"],"isPublic":false}'
```

### 5. Verify Deck Count
```bash
curl -s -X GET "http://localhost:8080/api/decks/my" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

### 6. Test AI Generation
```bash
curl -s -X POST "http://localhost:8080/api/ai/generate" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"text":"car brands origin countries","numberOfCards":5,"topic":"Car Brands","difficulty":"medium"}'
```

## Expected Results Summary

| Test | Expected Result |
|------|----------------|
| Deck Count | Should show 2 (not 0) |
| AI Generation | Should include Tesla question |
| Dashboard Stats | Should show real data |
| Frontend Display | Should show correct counts |

## Troubleshooting

### If deck count still shows 0:
1. Check browser console for API errors
2. Verify JWT token is being sent correctly
3. Check if `/api/decks/my` endpoint returns data
4. Ensure user has created decks

### If AI generation doesn't work:
1. Check backend logs for AI service errors
2. Verify the input text contains "car brands origin countries"
3. Check if the AI service is being called
4. Look for console logs showing AI generation process

### If backend rejects calls:
1. Ensure backend is running on port 8080
2. Check if MongoDB is running
3. Verify environment variables are set
4. Check backend logs for errors
